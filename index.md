# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Leonard Huynh and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Engineering.

## Computer Science Projects

My GitHub page is [http://github.com/leonard7476](https://github.com/leonard7476).

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was great in introducing and familiarizing us with GitHub. As someone who had never used GitHub prior to this class nor have I been too familiar with programming, this lab helped me understand how to basically navigate through GitHub. We also learned the basic commands needed in order for us to do and submit all our assignments for the rest of the semester. 

* Lab 5

    I enjoyed Lab 5 because this is where I learned how to use command line arguments. We were able to determine the amount of arguments required for our program to run properly. I actually did not know that error messages were manually made because I thought that the system just automatically does that which made it interesting for me to realize we would create the error messages ourselves. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was interesting to me because I did not know that we could create our own animated GIF through programming. This lab being the last lab made sense because it opened my eyes to how flexible programming can be. It is so cool creating an animated image by looping randomly colored pixels as well as being able to create a message on top of all that.
